# The following code will prove the hypothesis: "University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions."
# Data is pulled from the following locations:
# - From the Zillow research data site there is housing data for the United States. In particular the datafile for all homes 
#   at a city level, City_Zhvi_AllHomes.csv, has median home sale prices at a fine grained level.
# - From the Wikipedia page on college towns is a list of university towns in the United States which has been copy and pasted 
#   into the file university_towns.txt.
# - From Bureau of Economic Analysis, US Department of Commerce, the GDP over time of the United States in current dollars 
#   (use the chained value in 2009 dollars), in quarterly intervals, in the file gdplev.xls. For this assignment, only look at
#    GDP data from the first quarter of 2000 onward.
